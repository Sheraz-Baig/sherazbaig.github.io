**Blog#1 - Lessons from Brilliant Minds: Philosophies That Shape My Life and Career**

Throughout history, wise words have carried the power to inspire, challenge, and guide. I’ve discovered that the wisdom of great thinkers often navigates/shapes my career journey. 

As an engineer, I view life as a balance between structure and creativity, and quotes help me anchor that balance. I deeply admire the insights of remarkable minds whose words continue to resonate with me, offering clarity in moments of both challenge and growth. 

For me, these quotes are more than reflections of intelligence — they are guiding philosophies I strive to live by. Below, I share few principles/concepts from some brilliant people that continue to shape my life and career journey:

- Charlie Munger’s wisdom: Live wisely/rationally, keep learning, avoid envy, avoid foolish mistakes, invest with patient discipline, be reliable, and surround yourself with reliable people.
- Warren Buffett’s wisdom: Think long-term, stay disciplined, avoid unnecessary/illogical risks, invest only in what you understand, and be patient.
- Elon Musk’s mindset: Envision the extraordinary, act with relentless drive, embrace calculated/logical risk, learn obsessively, and push boundaries to create what others think is impossible.
- Kobe Bryant’s concept: Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses.
- Tim Cook’s principles: Act with integrity, focus on excellence, prioritize innovation and sustainability, elevate your mindset/thinking, and make thoughtful, values-driven decisions.
- Ikigai’s theory: Find purpose/meaning/goals at the intersection of what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for."
